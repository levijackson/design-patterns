# Design Patterns
Some closer to real-world examples for some design patterns.

# Tests
The tests for each example live in a similar directory structure. For example:
- `src/Structural/Decorator/Users/` are the source files
- `tests/Unit/Structural/Decorator/Users/` are the test files

You can run them by executing `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/`
